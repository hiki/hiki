! How to make a patch

Unified diff format is recommended.
Add a -u option to the diff command.

If you get files via Git, type the following command.
  $ git diff

You also can pull request to http://github.com/hiki/hiki.

! Create the original version control backend

1. put a script to "hiki/repos/#{repos_type}.rb"
2. Define "HikifarmRepos#{repos_type.capitalize}" class and
   "Repos#{repos_type.capitalize}" class which is derived from
   HikifarmReposBase and ReposBase.
3. Override methods properly.
